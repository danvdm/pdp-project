Insanely undocumented wall of code that should run if you press knit

You can download the folder and set the working directory of the folder in one of the first lines in the Main.Rmd file. 
If knitted, it should show the original results. 
If wanted individual chunks can be set to eval=TRUE and the data will be simulated new (will probably take an hour or so)
